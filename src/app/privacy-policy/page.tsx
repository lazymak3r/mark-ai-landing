          sharing requires us to transfer your Personal Information to one or more of our affiliates outside of
          Switzerland, including to the United States, where your Personal Information is stored.<br/>
          <br/>For the sake of completeness, we would like to point out that the U.S. authorities may take surveillance
          measures under U.S. law that allow general storage of all data transferred from the European Union or
          Switzerland to the United States. This is done without distinction, limitation or exception, on the basis of
          the objective pursued and without objective criteria that would allow limiting the access of the U.S.
          authorities to Personal Information and their subsequent use to specific, strictly limited purposes that
          justify access to such data. In addition, we would like to point out that there are no legal remedies in the
          U.S. for data subjects from EU Member States or Switzerland that would allow them to obtain access to the data
          concerning them and to obtain its correction or deletion, and that there is no effective legal protection
          against general access rights of the U.S. authorities. We expressly draw the data subject&#39;s attention to
          this legal and factual situation so that he or she can make an informed decision about consenting to the use
          of his or her data.<br/>When we transfer your Personal Information to another country, we ensure that our
          affiliate is able to provide the same adequate protection of that data as we provide, through internal
          standard contractual clauses or binding corporate rules between the AI Startup Generator group.<br/>
          <br/>In addition, we may share your Personal Information with a third party in order to complete our business
          commitment to you or to comply with a legal obligation associated with our relationship, as necessary to

          Generator conducts the same evaluation of adequacy to ensure that your Personal Information is protected. We
          will ensure by contract that the third party will not be permitted to process your Personal Information for
          any other purposes and in any other manner than we would be permitted.<br/>
          <br/>AI Startup Generator will not share or sell your Personal Information with a third party for any purpose

          (&ldquo;EEA&rdquo;), this portion of our Policy advises you of your rights and protections under applicable
          law regarding the processing of your &ldquo;personal data,&rdquo; as defined by the Swiss Federal Act on Data
          Protection (&ldquo;FADP&rdquo;), including the Ordinance to the Federal Act on Data Protection
          (&ldquo;OFADP&rdquo;), the Telecommunications Act (&ldquo;TCA&rdquo;), and the European General Data
          Protection Regulation (&ldquo;GDPR&rdquo;). When we process your personal data, we will only do so when we
          have your consent or if we can rely on any other legal basis permitting the processing of personal data. When
          processing is based on consent, you have the right to revoke your previously granted consent at any time with
          effect for the future by sending an email to privacy@AIStartupGenerator.com.<br/>
          <br/>We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we
          collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
          Details of retention periods for different aspects of your Personal Information are available in our retention
          policy, which is available from our Data Protection Manager. To determine the appropriate retention period for
          Personal Information, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the
          potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your Personal Information, the purposes for
          which we process your Personal Information and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and
          the applicable legal requirements. In some circumstances, we may anonymize your Personal Information so that
          it can no longer be associated with you, in which case we may use such information without further notice to
          you. When permitted or it is appropriate to do so, we will securely destroy your Personal Information in
          accordance with applicable laws and regulations. There may be specific statutory data retention obligations.
          Swiss law requires, for example, that business communication, concluded contracts and booking receipts must be
          stored for up to 10 years.<br/>
          <br/>We are entitled to pass on your personal data to third-party companies abroad as described above
          under &quot;Disclosing your personal data to Third Parties&quot;. These third-party companies are obliged to
          respect your privacy to the same extent as we do. If the level of data protection in a country is considered
          inadequate within the meaning of the FADP or the GDPR, we will ensure, by means of a contract, that your
          personal data is protected according to Swiss regulations or the GDPR at all times.<br/>
